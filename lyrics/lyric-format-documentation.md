# File format for song lyrics

All lyric files should be limited to only alphabetical characters and digits. 
No parenthesis, punctuation, or quotes (These characters will be ignored by the translator).

All blank lines will be ignored by the translator.

We can indicate song sections by enclosing them in brackets and putting them on their own line. Song sections must be unique.

Whitepsace separates words. A double dash (`--`) indicates a pause in the words when music is playing.
